rem KEEP THIS FILE PURE ASCII (English comments only).
rem cmd.exe reads .bat files using the system OEM codepage (e.g. 936/GBK on
rem Chinese Windows), NOT UTF-8. Non-ASCII characters in comments get decoded
rem into garbage that cmd then tries to execute, which breaks the whole script.
rem `chcp 65001` does not help here -- it only changes console output encoding,
rem not how the batch file itself is decoded.
